## About Canvass
Canvass is a chatting cum discussion forum built for our institution Punjab Engineering College.
Our college comprises of various cultural clubs and technical societies, however the only means for them to communicate with each other is by means of Whatsapp groups. 

So,we decided to take this to the net level by giving them a platform to not only communicate with each other but also with those interested in being a part of the club in the near future.It will also make inter club communication easier for them.

the second part of the project aims at allowing users to create their own interest groups,where people having common intereset can share their thoughts with their peers.
